### Description

This program sets one of its winsocks as a proxy and from this you are able to interecpt and alter the data being transfered from IE to the remote host. If you take a look at the screen shot you can see what i was able to do to Yahoo.com with i simple line of code. Please tell me what you think and/or how i can make this better. And i also took it upon myself to make this into an easy control to make building a "Net Nanny" program much easier.
